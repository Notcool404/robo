AIM: Create an automation UiPath project using different types of variables.

Click on Process and create a process Practical2B, give the description as Different types of variables, and click on Create.

From Activities, drag Sequence, then drag Build Data Table inside it.

Click on the Data Table, and the Build Data Table window will appear. Click on X to remove the default column, then click on + to add column headings Name and SAPID. Add some records inside them and click OK.

Now, create a variable to store the output of the Data Table by clicking on the empty field beside Data Table in the Properties panel and pressing CTRL + K. This will create a DataTable type variable.

To display the Data Table, drag Output Data Table and drop it below the Data Table. In Properties, create a Result variable that will store the table data as a string.

Now, create the following variables:

1) x of type Int32
2) name of type String
3) datetime of type DateTime (search it in variable type)
4) y of type 

Assign default values to them. Change their scope to Sequence so they are accessible within the sequence.

Drag a Message Box, open the editor inside it, and write an output expression for all created variables.

Run the file, and the output of different variables will be displayed.
